# Maths - A new way to do math ðŸ§®

Maths is a simple expressive language for performing mathmatical operations
and calculations. 

## --  Features

* Variable Assignment: Using the `let` keyword create variables that can store expressions or values.
* Your Basic Math: Your standard symbols for math `*, +, ^` etc.
** Conditional Statements: Using `???` to create a if block that stores a condition
  A condition `<, >, ==` what if it's false? use the `!!!` else operator.
* Printing: Using `throw` you can print any string and variables using the variable reference symbol `$`
** Returning: Maths has to ways of returning a final result. `;<variable_name>` is the final statement in your maths file.
   `;result` cannot be used to terminate a value early. `;result` must be at the end of the file. 
   Use `;result;` to return early disregarding 
  
   
## PS

* This is still in early stages. I am new to rust, and just trying to learn the way.
* This is a project I will find my self using, so if you have any additions, or comments, please GIMMEE.
