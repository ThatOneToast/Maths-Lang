# Maths - A new way to do math 🧮

Maths is a simple expressive language for performing mathmatical operations
and calculations. 

## Features ⚡️

* Variable Assignment: Using the `let` keyword create variables that can store expressions or values.
* Context Parameters: Using `#[paramater1, paramater2]` at the top of your maths file, you can pass in parameters to your maths expression..
* Your Basic Math: Your standard symbols for math `*, +, ^` etc.
* Conditional Statements: Using `???` or `if` to create an if block that takes in a condition.
* Print out a variables value by using `;` followed by the variable name.
